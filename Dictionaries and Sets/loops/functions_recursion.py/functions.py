# def greet(name="kartikey verma"):      # by assigning a name into the greet function when  
#     print("hello, good morning"+name)  # we will not input any name into it , it will take the assigned name as a default parameter
# greet()             # here we can see greet funtion takes kartikey verma as an input , just because we made it a default parameter
