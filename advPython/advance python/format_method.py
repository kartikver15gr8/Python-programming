# (f"Strings") were introduced in python 3.6, before python 3.6 there was no (f"strings") , so in that case we used to make our jobs done by using format method.

# An example of format method is given below :

name = "KARTIKEY VERMA"
company = "Google"

a = "The employee {} works in the company {} as a Senior Data Scientist".format(name,company)
print(a)
