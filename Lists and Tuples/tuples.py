# Creating a tuple using ()

cena = ("john","cena","never","give","up")      # creating a tuple

print(cena)

# cena[0] = "brock"       # This will throw an error since we can't update the elements in tuple

            # "we can't update the elements in tuple" 
            # So basically this is the main  difference between "lists" and "tuples"
